# The PP Project: Pathfinder and Programming Project (Acronym to be changed later), Updated: 19 October 2018
### aka "How to justify leaarning programming and other dev stuff while really learning how to torture my friends with my imagination!"

## Genesis/Overview:
My friends recently asked me to DM as they believe rightly or wrongly that I am a somewhat responsible person.

In this age when a buffoon can be the president of a superpower, I figured, why not? 

I also wanted to improve my skills at programming. Surely, there could be a way to merge these two projects into one unholy teleportation accident of a project?

So began,

## Potential Sub-Projects
### 0. Rolling the Dice and Taking a Chance: Create a means of simulating dice rolls, so we can avoid the whole fumbling around thing. 
- Ideally this would be DM-facing and for DM-us to avoid having to roll every time. 
- Could be done in straight python.

### 1. Player Tracker: System for keeping track of/simulating players. 
- Instatiate players, player object and player properties could be determined by reading of a text file. Program reads text description and assembles an instance of player object. Could be way of allowing rapid text input

### 2. Battle Simulator/Tabulator: Simulating a combat encounter or tabulating.
- Again rapid way of generating a battlefield. Allowing for actions. 
- Could be all done in console or with some sort of web framework
- Narrative
  - Player 1 and Player 2 are instantiated. So are Enemies from Enemy List.
  - "Interactions" (i.e. violence) happens. Calculations and such are done on paper. 
  - Results are tabulated and textfiles with relevant information are updated. 

### 3. Cronaca: A simple chronicle online (Django?) of all the events
- Just a way of keeping tabs and saving state of the game on website.
